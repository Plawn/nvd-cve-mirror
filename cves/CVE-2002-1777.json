  "summary": "** DISPUTED ** NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor. Symantec Norton AntiVirus (NAV) 2002 allows remote attackers to bypass e-mail scanning via a filename in the Content-Type field with an excluded extension such as .nch or .dbx, but a malicious extension in the Content-Disposition field, which is used by Outlook to obtain the file name.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, acknowledging that the initial scan is bypassed, but Norton AntiVirus or the Office plug-in would detect the virus before it is executed.",
