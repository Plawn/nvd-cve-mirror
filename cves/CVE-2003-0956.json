  "summary": "Multiple race conditions in the handling of O_DIRECT in Linux kernel prior to version 2.4.22 could cause stale data to be returned from the disk when handling sparse files, or cause incorrect data to be returned when a file is truncated as it is being read, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive data that was originally owned by other users, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0018.",
