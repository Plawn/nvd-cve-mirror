  "summary": "The user interface in the Windows Firewall does not properly display certain malformed entries in the Windows Registry, which makes it easier for attackers with administrator privileges to hide activities if the administrator only uses the Windows Firewall interface to monitor exceptions.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, saying that since administrative privileges are already required, it is not a vulnerability.  CVE has not yet formally decided if such \"information hiding\" issues should be included.",
