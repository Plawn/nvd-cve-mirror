  "summary": "** DISPUTED **  SQL injection vulnerability in WebDB 1.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified search parameters, possibly Search0.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, saying that \"WebDB is a generic online database system used by many of the clients of Lois Software. The flaw that was identified was some code that was added for a client to do some testing of his system and only certain safe commands were allowed. This code has now been removed and it is not now possible to use SQL queries as part of the query string.  No installation or patch is required All clients use a common code library and have their own front end and databases and connections. So as soon as a change / upgrade / enhancement is made to the code, all users of the software begin to use the latest changes immediately.\"  Since the issue appeared in a custom web site and no action is required on the part of customers, this issue should not be included in CVE.",
