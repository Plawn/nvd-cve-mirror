  "summary": "PowerPoint in Microsoft Office 2000, XP, 2003, 2004 for Mac, and v.X for Mac does not properly parse the slide notes field in a document, which allows remote user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted data in this field, which triggers an erroneous object pointer calculation that uses data from within the document. NOTE: this issue is different than other PowerPoint vulnerabilities including CVE-2006-4694.",
