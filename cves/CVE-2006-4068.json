  "summary": "The pswd.js script relies on the client to calculate whether a username and password match hard-coded hashed values for a server, and uses a hashing scheme that creates a large number of collisions, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct offline brute force attacks.  NOTE: this script might also allow attackers to generate the server-side \"secret\" URL without determining the original password, but this possibility was not discussed by the original researcher.",
