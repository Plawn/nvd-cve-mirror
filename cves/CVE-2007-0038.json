  "summary": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the animated cursor code in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4 through Vista allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (persistent reboot) via a large length value in the second (or later) anih block of a RIFF .ANI, cur, or .ico file, which results in memory corruption when processing cursors, animated cursors, and icons, a variant of CVE-2005-0416, as originally demonstrated using Internet Explorer 6 and 7. NOTE: this might be a duplicate of CVE-2007-1765; if so, then CVE-2007-0038 should be preferred.",
