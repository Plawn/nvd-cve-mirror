  "summary": "Multiple buffer overflows in Firebird 2.1 allow attackers to trigger memory corruption and possibly have other unspecified impact via certain input processed by (1) config\\ConfigFile.cpp or (2) msgs\\check_msgs.epp.  NOTE: if ConfigFile.cpp reads a configuration file with restrictive permissions, then the ConfigFile.cpp vector may not cross privilege boundaries and perhaps should not be included in CVE.",
