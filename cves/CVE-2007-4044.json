  "summary": "** REJECT **  The MS-RPC functionality in smbd in Samba 3 on SUSE Linux before 20070720 does not include \"one character in the shell escape handling.\"  NOTE: this issue was originally characterized as a shell metacharacter issue due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-2447, which was interpreted by CVE to be security relevant.  However, SUSE and Red Hat have disputed the problem, stating that the only impact is that scripts will not be executed if they have a \"c\" in their name, but even this limitation might not exist.  This does not have security implications, so should not be included in CVE.",
