  "summary": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in MoinMoin 1.5.8 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) certain input processed by formatter/text_gedit.py (aka the gui editor formatter); (2) a page name, which triggers an injection in PageEditor.py when the page is successfully deleted by a victim in a DeletePage action; or (3) the destination page name for a RenamePage action, which triggers an injection in PageEditor.py when a victim's rename attempt fails because of a duplicate name.  NOTE: the AttachFile XSS issue is already covered by CVE-2008-0781, and the login XSS issue is already covered by CVE-2008-0780.",
