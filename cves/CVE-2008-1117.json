  "summary": "Directory traversal vulnerability in the Notes (aka Flash Notes or instant messages) feature in tb2ftp.dll in Timbuktu Pro 8.6.5 for Windows, and possibly 8.7 for Mac OS X, allows remote attackers to upload files to arbitrary locations via a destination filename with a \\ (backslash) character followed by ../ (dot dot slash) sequences. NOTE: this can be leveraged for code execution by writing to a Startup folder.  NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-4220.",
