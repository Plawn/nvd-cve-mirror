  "summary": "cgi-bin/setup_dns.exe on the Belkin F5D7230-4 router with firmware 9.01.10 does not require authentication, which allows remote attackers to perform administrative actions, as demonstrated by changing a DNS server via the dns1_1, dns1_2, dns1_3, and dns1_4 parameters.  NOTE: it was later reported that F5D7632-4V6 with firmware 6.01.08 is also affected.",
