  "summary": "The shellescape function in Vim 7.0 through 7.2, including 7.2a.10, allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via the \"!\" (exclamation point) shell metacharacter in (1) the filename of a ZIP archive and possibly (2) the filename of the first file in a ZIP archive, which is not properly handled by zip.vim in the VIM ZIP plugin (zipPlugin.vim) v.11 through v.21, as demonstrated by the zipplugin and zipplugin.v2 test cases.  NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2712.  NOTE: this issue has the same root cause as CVE-2008-3074.  NOTE: due to the complexity of the associated disclosures and the incomplete information related to them, there may be inaccuracies in this CVE description and in external mappings to this identifier.",
