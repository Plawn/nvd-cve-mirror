  "summary": "Buffer overflow in the SQLVDIRLib.SQLVDirControl ActiveX control in Tools\\Binn\\sqlvdir.dll in Microsoft SQL Server 2000 (aka SQL Server 8.0) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (browser crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long URL in the second argument to the Connect method.
