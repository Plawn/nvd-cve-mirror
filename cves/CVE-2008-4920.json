  "summary": "** REJECT **  DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs: None.  Reason: this candidate was based on an incorrect claim regarding a directory issue in Agavi.  The vendor has disputed the issue and the original researcher has retracted the original claim, so this is not a vulnerability.  Further investigation by the vendor and original researcher show that the original issue was in a site-specific modification, which is outside the scope of CVE.  Notes: CVE users should not use this identifier.",
