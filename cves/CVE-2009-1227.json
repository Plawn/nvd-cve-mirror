  "summary": "** DISPUTED **  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor.  Buffer overflow in the PKI Web Service in Check Point Firewall-1 PKI Web Service allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long (1) Authorization or (2) Referer HTTP header to TCP port 18624.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, stating \"Check Point Security Alert Team has analyzed this report. We've tried to reproduce the attack on all VPN-1 versions from NG FP2 and above with and without HFAs. The issue was not reproduced. We have conducted a thorough analysis of the relevant code and verified that we are secure against this attack. We consider this attack to pose no risk to Check Point customers.\"  In addition, the original researcher, whose reliability is unknown as of 20090407, also states that the issue \"was discovered during a pen-test where the client would not allow further analysis.\"",
