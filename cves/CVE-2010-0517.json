  "summary": "Heap-based buffer overflow in QuickTime in Apple Mac OS X before 10.6.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted movie file with M-JPEG encoding, which causes QuickTime to calculate a buffer size using height and width fields, but to use a different field to control the length of a copy operation.",
