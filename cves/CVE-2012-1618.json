  "summary": "Interaction error in the PostgreSQL JDBC driver before 8.2, when used with a PostgreSQL server with the \"standard_conforming_strings\" option enabled, such as the default configuration of PostgreSQL 9.1, does not properly escape unspecified JDBC statement parameters, which allows remote attackers to perform SQL injection attacks. NOTE: as of 20120330, it was claimed that the upstream developer planned to dispute this issue, but an official dispute has not been posted as of 20121005.",
