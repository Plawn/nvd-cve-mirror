  "summary": "The do_tmem_destroy_pool function in the Transcendent Memory (TMEM) in Xen 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2 does not properly validate pool ids, which allows local guest OS users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and host crash) or execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this issue was originally published as part of CVE-2012-3497, which was too general; CVE-2012-3497 has been SPLIT into this ID and others.",
