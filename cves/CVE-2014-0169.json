  "summary": "In JBoss EAP 6 a security domain is configured to use a cache that is shared between all applications that are in the security domain. This could allow an authenticated user in one application to access protected resources in another application without proper authorization. Although this is an intended functionality, it was not clearly documented which can mislead users into thinking that a security domain cache is isolated to a single application.",
