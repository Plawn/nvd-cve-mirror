  "summary": "A specific device configuration can result in a commit failure condition. When this occurs, a user is logged in without being prompted for a password while trying to login through console, ssh, ftp, telnet or su, etc., This issue relies upon a device configuration precondition to occur. Typically, device configurations are the result of a trusted administrative change to the system's running configuration. The following error messages may be seen when this failure occurs: mgd: error: commit failed: (statements constraint check failed) Warning: Commit failed, activating partial configuration.
