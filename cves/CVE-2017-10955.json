  "summary": "** DISPUTED ** This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of EMC Data Protection Advisor 6.3.0. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the EMC DPA Application service, which listens on TCP port 9002 by default. When parsing the preScript parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-4697. NOTE: Dell EMC disputes that this is a vulnerability.",
