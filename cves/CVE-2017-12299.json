  "summary": "A vulnerability exists in the process of creating default IP blocks during device initialization for Cisco ASA Next-Generation Firewall Services that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send traffic to the local IP address of the device, bypassing any filters that are configured to deny local IP management traffic. The vulnerability is due to an implementation error that exists in the process of creating default IP blocks when the device is initialized, and the way in which those IP blocks interact with user-configured filters for local IP management traffic (for example, SSH to the device). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic to the local IP address of the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to connect to the local IP address of the device even when there are filters configured to deny the traffic. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd97962.",
