  "summary": "A vulnerability in the TCL scripting subsystem of Cisco NX-OS System Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escape the interactive TCL shell and gain unauthorized access to the underlying operating system of the device. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied files passed to the interactive TCL shell of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to escape the scripting sandbox and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the authenticated user. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have local access and be authenticated to the targeted device with administrative or tclsh execution privileges. This vulnerability affects the following products running Cisco NX-OS System Software: Multilayer Director Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5000 Series Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules, Unified Computing System Manager. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve93750, CSCve93762, CSCve93763, CSCvg04127.",
