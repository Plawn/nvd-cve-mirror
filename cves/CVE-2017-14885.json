  "summary": "In Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, QRD Android, with all Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel, wma_unified_link_peer_stats_event_handler function has a variable num_rates which represents the sum of all the peer_stats->num_rates. The current behavior in this function is to validate only the num_rates of the first peer stats (peer_stats->num_rates) against WMA_SVC_MSG_MAX_SIZE, but not the sum of all the peer's num_rates (num_rates) which may lead to a buffer overflow when the firmware buffer is copied in to the allocated buffer (peer_stats) as the size for the memory allocation - link_stats_results_size is based on num_rates.",
