  "summary": "Import Signal Tone function in Huawei eSpace 7950 V200R003C30; eSpace 8950 V200R003C00; V200R003C30 has a remote code execution vulnerability. An authenticated, remote attacker can craft and send the packets to the affected products after the Signal Tone is uploaded. Due to insufficient verification of the packets, this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.",
