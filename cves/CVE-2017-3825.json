  "summary": "A vulnerability in the ICMP ingress packet processing of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the TelePresence endpoint to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation for the size of a received ICMP packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted ICMP packet to the local IP address of the targeted endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS of the TelePresence endpoint, during which time calls could be dropped. This vulnerability would affect either IPv4 or IPv6 ICMP traffic. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco TelePresence products when running software release CE8.1.1, CE8.2.0, CE8.2.1, CE8.2.2, CE 8.3.0, or CE8.3.1: Spark Room OS, TelePresence DX Series, TelePresence MX Series, TelePresence SX Quick Set Series, TelePresence SX Series.
