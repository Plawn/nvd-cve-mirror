  "summary": "A vulnerability in the web-based user interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker read and write access to information stored in the affected system as well as perform remote code execution. The attacker must have valid user credentials. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing an XML file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the administrator of an affected system to import a crafted XML file with malicious entries which could allow the attacker to read and write files and execute remote code within the application, aka XML Injection. Cisco Prime Infrastructure software releases 1.1 through 3.1.6 are vulnerable. Cisco EPNM software releases 1.2, 2.0, and 2.1 are vulnerable. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc23894 CSCvc49561.",
