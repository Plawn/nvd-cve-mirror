  "summary": "A vulnerability in the cache server within Cisco Videoscape Distribution Suite (VDS) for Television 3.2(5)ES1 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on a targeted appliance. The vulnerability is due to excessive mapped connections exhausting the allotted resources within the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending large amounts of inbound traffic to a device with the intention of overloading certain resources. A successful exploit could cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc39260.",
