  "summary": "An issue was discovered on Securifi Almond, Almond+, and Almond 2015 devices with firmware AL-R096. The device provides a user with the capability of blocking IP addresses using the web management interface. It seems that the device does not implement any cross-site scripting forgery protection mechanism which allows an attacker to trick a user who is logged in to the web management interface into executing a cross-site scripting payload on the user's browser and execute any action on the device provided by the web management interface.",
