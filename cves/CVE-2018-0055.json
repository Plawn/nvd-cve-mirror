  "summary": "Receipt of a specially crafted DHCPv6 message destined to a Junos OS device configured as a DHCP server in a Broadband Edge (BBE) environment may result in a jdhcpd daemon crash. The daemon automatically restarts without intervention, but a continuous receipt of crafted DHCPv6 packets could leaded to an extended denial of service condition. This issue only affects Junos OS 15.1 and later. Earlier releases are unaffected by this issue. Devices are only vulnerable to the specially crafted DHCPv6 message if DHCP services are configured. Devices not configured to act as a DHCP server are not vulnerable to this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S2; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D160; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D235, 15.1X53-D495; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R4-S11, 16.1R6-S6, 16.1R7-S2; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S7; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S9; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R2-S6; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S1; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S5; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2-S3; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R1-S2; 18.2X75 versions prior to 18.2X75-D20.",
