  "summary": "A vulnerability in the use of JSON web tokens by the web-based service portal of Cisco Elastic Services Controller Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain administrative access to an affected system. The vulnerability is due to the presence of static default credentials for the web-based service portal of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by extracting the credentials from an image of the affected software and using those credentials to generate a valid administrative session token for the web-based service portal of any other installation of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain administrative access to the web-based service portal of an affected system. This vulnerability affects Cisco Elastic Services Controller Software Release 3.0.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg30884.",
