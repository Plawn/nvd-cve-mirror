  "summary": "A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem communication channel through the Cisco 550X Series Stackable Managed Switches could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. The device nay need to be manually reloaded to recover. The vulnerability is due to lack of proper input throttling of ingress SNMP traffic over an internal interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted, heavy stream of SNMP traffic to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, causing a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg22135.",
