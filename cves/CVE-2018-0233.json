  "summary": "A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) packet reassembly functionality of the detection engine in Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the detection engine to consume excessive system memory on an affected device, which could cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to the affected software improperly handling changes to SSL connection states. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SSL connections through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the detection engine to consume excessive system memory on the affected device, which could cause a DoS condition. The device may need to be reloaded manually to recover from this condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco Firepower System Software Releases 6.0.0 and later, running on any of the following Cisco products: Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series Firewalls with FirePOWER Services, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls, Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Networks, 7000 Series Appliances, Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Networks, 8000 Series Appliances, Firepower 4100 Series Appliances, FirePOWER 7000 Series Appliances, FirePOWER 8000 Series Appliances, Firepower 9300 Series Security Appliances, Firepower Threat Defense for Integrated Services Routers (ISRs), Firepower Threat Defense Virtual for VMware, Industrial Security Appliance 3000, Sourcefire 3D System Appliances.
