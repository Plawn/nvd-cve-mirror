  "summary": "A vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause one of the detection engine processes to run out of memory and thus slow down traffic processing. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of traffic when the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) inspection policy is enabled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious traffic through an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to increase the resource consumption of a single instance of the Snort detection engine on an affected device. This will lead to performance degradation and eventually the restart of the affected Snort process. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvi09219, CSCvi29845.",
