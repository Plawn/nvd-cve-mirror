  "summary": "A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Teams (for Windows and macOS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's device, possibly with elevated privileges. The vulnerability occurs because Cisco Webex Teams does not properly sanitize input. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a user a malicious link and persuading the user to follow the link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh66250.",
