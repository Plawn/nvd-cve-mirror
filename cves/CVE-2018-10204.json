  "summary": "PureVPN 6.0.1 for Windows suffers from a SYSTEM privilege escalation vulnerability in its \"sevpnclient\" service. When configured to use the OpenVPN protocol, the \"sevpnclient\" service executes \"openvpn.exe\" using the OpenVPN config file located at %PROGRAMDATA%\\purevpn\\config\\config.ovpn. This file allows \"Write\" permissions to users in the \"Everyone\" group. An authenticated attacker may modify this file to specify a dynamic library plugin that should run for every new VPN connection attempt. This plugin will execute code in the context of the SYSTEM account.",
