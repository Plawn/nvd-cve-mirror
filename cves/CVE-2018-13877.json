  "summary": "The doPayouts() function of the smart contract implementation for MegaCryptoPolis, an Ethereum game, has a Denial of Service vulnerability. If a smart contract that has a fallback function always causing exceptions buys a land, users cannot buy lands near that contract's land, because those purchase attempts will not be completed unless the doPayouts() function successfully sends Ether to certain neighbors.",
