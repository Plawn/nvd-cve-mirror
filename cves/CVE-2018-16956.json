  "summary": "The AjaxControl component of Oracle WebCenter Interaction Portal 10.3.3 does not validate the names of pages when processing page rename requests. Pages can be renamed to include characters unsupported for URIs by the web server hosting the WCI Portal software (such as IIS). Renaming pages to include unsupported characters, such as 0x7f, prevents these pages from being accessed over the web server, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) to the page. NOTE: this CVE is assigned by MITRE and isn't validated by Oracle because Oracle WebCenter Interaction Portal is out of support.",
