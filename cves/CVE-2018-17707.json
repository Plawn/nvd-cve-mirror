  "summary": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Epic Games Launcher versions prior to 8.2.2. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handler for the com.epicgames.launcher protocol. A crafted URI with the com.epicgames.launcher protocol can trigger execution of a system call composed from a user-supplied string.
