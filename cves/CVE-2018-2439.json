  "summary": "The SAP Internet Graphics Server (IGS), 7.20, 7.20EXT, 7.45, 7.49, 7.53, has insufficient request validation (for example, where the request is validated for authenticity and validity) and under certain conditions, will process invalid requests. Several areas of the SAP Internet Graphics Server (IGS) did not require sufficient input validation. Namely, the SAP Internet Graphics Server (IGS) HTTP and RFC listener, SAP Internet Graphics Server (IGS) portwatcher when registering a portwatcher to the multiplexer and the SAP Internet Graphics Server (IGS) multiplexer had insufficient input validation and thus allowing a malformed data packet to cause a crash.",
