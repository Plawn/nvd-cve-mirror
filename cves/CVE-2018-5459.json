  "summary": "An Improper Authentication issue was discovered in WAGO PFC200 Series 3S CoDeSys Runtime versions 2.3.X and 2.4.X. An attacker can execute different unauthenticated remote operations because of the CoDeSys Runtime application, which is available via network by default on Port 2455. An attacker could execute some unauthenticated commands such as reading, writing, or deleting arbitrary files, or manipulate the PLC application during runtime by sending specially-crafted TCP packets to Port 2455.",
