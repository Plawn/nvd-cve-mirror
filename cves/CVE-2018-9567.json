  "summary": "On Pixel devices there is a bug causing verified boot to show the same certificate fingerprint despite using different signing keys. This may lead to local escalation of privilege if people are relying on those fingerprints to determine what version of the OS the device is running, with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android. Versions: Android kernel. Android ID: A-65543936.",
