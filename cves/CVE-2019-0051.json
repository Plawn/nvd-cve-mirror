  "summary": "SSL-Proxy feature on SRX devices fails to handle a hardware resource limitation which can be exploited by remote SSL/TLS servers to crash the flowd daemon. Repeated crashes of the flowd daemon can result in an extended denial of service condition. For this issue to occur, clients protected by the SRX device must initiate a connection to the malicious server. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX5000 Series: 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D85; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D180; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S7; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S6, 17.4R3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S8; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2.",
