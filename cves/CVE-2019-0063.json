  "summary": "When an MX Series Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS) is configured as a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) with DHCPv6 enabled, jdhcpd might crash when receiving a specific crafted DHCP response message on a subscriber interface. The daemon automatically restarts without intervention, but continuous receipt of specific crafted DHCP messages will repeatedly crash jdhcpd, leading to an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue only affects systems configured with DHCPv6 enabled. DHCPv4 is unaffected by this issue. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S5 on MX Series; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S5 on MX Series; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S10 on MX Series; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R3-S1 on MX Series; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3-S2 on MX Series; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S6 on MX Series; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S5, 17.4R3 on MX Series; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S6 on MX Series; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S4, 18.2R3 on MX Series; 18.2X75 versions prior to 18.2X75-D50 on MX Series; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R1-S5, 18.3R3 on MX Series; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2 on MX Series; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S2, 19.1R2 on MX Series.",
