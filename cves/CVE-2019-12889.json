  "summary": "An unauthenticated privilege escalation exists in SailPoint Desktop Password Reset 7.2. A user with local access to only the Windows logon screen can escalate their privileges to NT AUTHORITY\\System. An attacker would need local access to the machine for a successful exploit. The attacker must disconnect the computer from the local network / WAN and connect it to an internet facing access point / network. At that point, the attacker can execute the password-reset functionality, which will expose a web browser. Browsing to a site that calls local Windows system functions (e.g., file upload) will expose the local file system. From there an attacker can launch a privileged command shell.",
