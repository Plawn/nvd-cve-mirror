  "summary": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Intermediate System&ndash;to&ndash;Intermediate System (IS&ndash;IS) routing protocol functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition in the IS&ndash;IS process. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) request for specific Object Identifiers (OIDs) by the IS&ndash;IS process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition in the IS&ndash;IS process.",
