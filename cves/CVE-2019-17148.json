  "summary": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Parallels Desktop Parallels Desktop version 14.1.3 (45485). An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Parallels Service. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-8685.",
