  "summary": "A vulnerability in the HTTPS proxy feature of Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to use the Central Manager as an HTTPS proxy. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication of proxy connection requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTPS CONNECT message to the Central Manager. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access public internet resources that would normally be blocked by corporate policies.",
