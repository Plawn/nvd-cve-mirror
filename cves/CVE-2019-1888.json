  "summary": "A vulnerability in the Administration Web Interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files and execute commands on the underlying operating system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs valid Administrator credentials. The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions for the content uploaded to an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading arbitrary files containing operating system commands that will be executed by an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web interface and then elevate their privileges to root.",
