  "summary": "A vulnerability in Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system (OS) of an affected device as root. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of a configuration file that is accessible to a local shell user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input during the execution of this file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying OS as root.",
