  "summary": "D-Link DIR-859 1.05 and 1.06B01 Beta01 devices allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a urn: to the M-SEARCH method in ssdpcgi() in /htdocs/cgibin, because HTTP_ST is mishandled. The value of the urn: service/device is checked with the strstr function, which allows an attacker to concatenate arbitrary commands separated by shell metacharacters.",
