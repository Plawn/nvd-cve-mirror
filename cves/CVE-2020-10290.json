  "summary": "Universal Robots controller execute URCaps (zip files containing Java-powered applications) without any permission restrictions and a wide API that presents many primitives that can compromise the overall robot operations as demonstrated in our video. In our PoC we demonstrate how a malicious actor could 'cook' a custom URCap that when deployed by the user (intendedly or unintendedly) compromises the system",
