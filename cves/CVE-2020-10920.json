  "summary": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of C-MORE HMI EA9 Firmware version 6.52 touch screen panels. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the control service, which listens on TCP port 9999 by default. The issue results from the lack of authentication prior to allowing alterations to the system configuration. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device.
