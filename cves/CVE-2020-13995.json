  "summary": "U.S. Air Force Sensor Data Management System extract75 has a buffer overflow that leads to code execution. An overflow in a global variable (sBuffer) leads to a Write-What-Where outcome. Writing beyond sBuffer will clobber most global variables until reaching a pointer such as DES_info or image_info. By controlling that pointer, one achieves an arbitrary write when its fields are assigned. The data written is from a potentially untrusted NITF file in the form of an integer. The attacker can gain control of the instruction pointer.",
