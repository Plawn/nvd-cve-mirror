  "summary": "An issue was discovered on Dr Trust ECG Pen 2.00.08 devices. Because the Bluetooth LE support is implemented without a requirement for pairing or security, any attacker can access the GATT server of the device and can sniff the data being broadcasted while a measurement is being done. Also, saved data can also be extracted over a Bluetooth connection. In addition, an attacker can launch a man-in-the-middle attack against data integrity.",
