  "summary": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Senstar Symphony 7.3.2.2. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the SSOAuth process. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-10980.",
