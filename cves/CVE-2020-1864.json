  "summary": "Some Huawei products have a security vulnerability due to improper authentication. A remote attacker needs to obtain some information and forge the peer device to send specific packets to the affected device. Due to the improper implementation of the authentication function, attackers can exploit the vulnerability to connect to affected devices and execute a series of commands.Affected product versions include:Secospace AntiDDoS8000 versions V500R001C00,V500R001C20,V500R001C60,V500R005C00.",
