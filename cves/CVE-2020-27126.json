  "summary": "A vulnerability in an API of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting attacks. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input to an application programmatic interface (API) within Cisco Webex Meetings. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a targeted user to follow a link designed to submit malicious input to the API used by Cisco Webex Meetings. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct cross-site scripting attacks and potentially gain access to sensitive browser-based information from the system of a targeted user.",
