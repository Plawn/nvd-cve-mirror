  "summary": "A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) functionality of the standby route processor management interface of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to reach the configured IP addresses on the standby route processor management Gigabit Ethernet Management interface. The vulnerability is due to a logic error that was introduced in the Cisco IOS XR Software, which prevents the ACL from working when applied against the standby route processor management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to access the device through the standby route processor management interface.",
