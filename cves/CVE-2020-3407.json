  "summary": "A vulnerability in the RESTCONF and NETCONF-YANG access control list (ACL) function of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of the ACL that is tied to the RESTCONF or NETCONF-YANG feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the device using RESTCONF or NETCONF-YANG. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
