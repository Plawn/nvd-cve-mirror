  "summary": "A vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a device to reload. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of certain valid, but not typical, Ethernet frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending the Ethernet frames onto the Ethernet segment. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
