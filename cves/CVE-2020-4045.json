  "summary": "SSB-DB version 20.0.0 has an information disclosure vulnerability. The get() method is supposed to only decrypt messages when you explicitly ask it to, but there is a bug where it's decrypting any message that it can. This means that it is returning the decrypted content of private messages, which a malicious peer could use to get access to private data. This only affects peers running SSB-DB@20.0.0 who also have private messages, and is only known to be exploitable if you're also running SSB-OOO (default in SSB-Server), which exposes a thin wrapper around get() to anonymous peers. This is fixed in version 20.0.1. Note that users of SSB-Server verion 16.0.0 should upgrade to 16.0.1 to get the fixed version of SSB-DB.",
