  "summary": "In RedpwnCTF before version 2.3, there is a session fixation vulnerability in exploitable through the `#token=$ssid` hash when making a request to the `/verify` endpoint. An attacker team could potentially steal flags by, for example, exploiting a stored XSS payload in a CTF challenge so that victim teams who solve the challenge are unknowingly (and against their will) signed into the attacker team&#39;s account. Then, the attacker can gain points / value off the backs of the victims. This is patched in version 2.3.",
