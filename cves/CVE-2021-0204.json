  "summary": "A sensitive information disclosure vulnerability in delta-export configuration utility (dexp) of Juniper Networks Junos OS may allow a locally authenticated shell user the ability to create and read database files generated by the dexp utility, including password hashes of local users. Since dexp is shipped with setuid permissions enabled and is owned by the root user, this vulnerability may allow a local privileged user the ability to run dexp with root privileges and access sensitive information in the dexp database. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S8; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D230; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S9; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S12, 17.4R3-S3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S11; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S6; 18.2X75 versions prior to 18.2X75-D34; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S4; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S7, 18.4R3-S6; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S6, 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3-S3; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S5, 19.2R3-S1; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S5, 19.3R3-S1; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S3, 19.4R2-S2, 19.4R3-S1; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R1-S4, 20.1R2; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R1-S2, 20.2R2.",
