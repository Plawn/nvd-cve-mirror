  "summary": "A NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to send a specific packet causing the packet forwarding engine (PFE) to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). By continuously sending these specific packets, an attacker can repeatedly disable the PFE causing a sustained Denial of Service (DoS). This issue only affects Juniper Networks NFX Series, SRX Series platforms when SSL Proxy is configured. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on NFX Series and SRX Series: 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S4; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R3-S1; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R1-S6, 19.1R2-S2, 19.1R3; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S2, 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2.
