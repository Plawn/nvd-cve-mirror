  "summary": "Through routine static code analysis of the Juniper Networks Junos OS software codebase, the Secure Development Life Cycle team identified a Use After Free vulnerability in PFE packet processing on the QFX10002-60C switching platform. Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow a logically adjacent attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued exploitation of this vulnerability will sustain the Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue only affects QFX10002-60C devices. No other product or platform is vulnerable to this issue. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX10002-60C: 19.1 version 19.1R3-S1 and later versions; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S3; 19.2 version 19.2R2 and later versions; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S1; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R1-S2.
