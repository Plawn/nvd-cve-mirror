  "summary": "A vulnerability in the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PIM packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a traffic loop, resulting in a DoS condition.",
