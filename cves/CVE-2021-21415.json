  "summary": "Prisma VS Code a VSCode extension for Prisma schema files. This is a Remote Code Execution Vulnerability that affects all versions of the Prisma VS Code extension older than 2.20.0. If a custom binary path for the Prisma format binary is set in VS Code Settings, for example by downloading a project that has a .vscode/settings.json file that sets a value for \"prismaFmtBinPath\". That custom binary is executed when auto-formatting is triggered by VS Code or when validation checks are triggered after each keypress on a *.prisma file. Fixed in versions 2.20.0 and 20.0.27. As a workaround users can either edit or delete the `.vscode/settings.json` file or check if the binary is malicious and delete it.",
