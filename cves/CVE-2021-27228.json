  "summary": "An issue was discovered in Shinobi through ocean version 1. lib/auth.js has Incorrect Access Control. Valid API Keys are held in an internal JS Object. Therefore an attacker can use JS Proto Method names (such as constructor or hasOwnProperty) to convince the System that the supplied API Key exists in the underlying JS object, and consequently achieve complete access to User/Admin/Super API functions, as demonstrated by a /super/constructor/accounts/list URI.",
