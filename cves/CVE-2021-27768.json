  "summary": "Using the ability to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, which indicates a lack of hostname verification, sensitive account information was able to be intercepted. In this specific scenario, the application's network traffic was intercepted using a proxy server set up in 'transparent' mode while a certificate with an invalid hostname was active. The Android application was found to have hostname verification issues during the server setup and login flows; however, the application did not process requests post-login.",
