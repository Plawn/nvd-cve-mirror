  "summary": "GAEN (aka Google/Apple Exposure Notifications) through 2021-04-27 on Android allows attackers to obtain sensitive information, such as a user's location history, in-person social graph, and (sometimes) COVID-19 infection status, because Rolling Proximity Identifiers and MAC addresses are written to the Android system log, and many Android devices have applications (preinstalled by the hardware manufacturer or network operator) that read system log data and send it to third parties. NOTE: a news outlet (The Markup) states that they received a vendor response indicating that fix deployment \"began several weeks ago and will be complete in the coming days.\"",
