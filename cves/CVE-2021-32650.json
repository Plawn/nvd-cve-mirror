  "summary": "October CMS is a self-hosted content management system (CMS) platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. Prior to versions 1.0.473 and 1.1.6, an attacker with access to the backend is able to execute PHP code by using the theme import feature. This will bypass the safe mode feature that prevents PHP execution in the CMS templates.The issue has been patched in Build 473 (v1.0.473) and v1.1.6. Those unable to upgrade may apply the patch to their installation manually as a workaround.",
