  "summary": "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC PCS 7 V8.2 (All versions), SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.0 (All versions < V9.0 SP3 UC04), SIMATIC PCS 7 V9.1 (All versions < V9.1 SP1), SIMATIC WinCC V15 and earlier (All versions < V15 SP1 Update 7), SIMATIC WinCC V16 (All versions < V16 Update 5), SIMATIC WinCC V17 (All versions < V17 Update 2), SIMATIC WinCC V7.4 (All versions < V7.4 SP1 Update 19), SIMATIC WinCC V7.5 (All versions < V7.5 SP2 Update 5). Legitimate file operations on the web server of the affected systems do not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname. An attacker could then cause the pathname to resolve to a location outside of the restricted directory on the server and read, write or delete unexpected critical files.",
