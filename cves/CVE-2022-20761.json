  "summary": "A vulnerability in the integrated wireless access point (AP) packet processing of the Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Router (CGR1K) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of received traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the integrated AP to stop processing traffic, resulting in a DoS condition. It may be necessary to manually reload the CGR1K to restore AP operation.",
