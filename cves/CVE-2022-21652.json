  "summary": "Shopware is an open source e-commerce software platform. In affected versions shopware would not invalidate a user session in the event of a password change. With version 5.7.7 the session validation was adjusted, so that sessions created prior to the latest password change of a customer account can't be used to login with said account. This also means, that upon a password change, all existing sessions for a given customer account are automatically considered invalid. There is no workaround for this issue.",
