  "summary": "Specific BD Pyxis™ products were installed with default credentials and may presently still operate with these credentials. There may be scenarios where BD Pyxis™ products are installed with the same default local operating system credentials or domain-joined server(s) credentials that may be shared across product types. If exploited, threat actors may be able to gain privileged access to the underlying file system and could potentially exploit or gain access to ePHI or other sensitive information.",
