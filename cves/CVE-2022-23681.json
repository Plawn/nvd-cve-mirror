  "summary": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the AOS-CX command line interface that could lead to authenticated command injection. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root on the underlying operating system leading to complete switch compromise in ArubaOS-CX version(s): AOS-CX 10.09.xxxx: 10.09.1030 and below, AOS-CX 10.08.xxxx: 10.08.1030 and below, AOS-CX 10.06.xxxx: 10.06.0180 and below.
