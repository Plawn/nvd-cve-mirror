  "summary": "** DISPUTED ** ecjia-daojia 1.38.1-20210202629 is vulnerable to information leakage via content/apps/installer/classes/Helper.php. When the web program is installed, a new environment file is created, and the database information is recorded, including the database record password. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the environment file is in the data directory, which is not intended for access by website visitors (only the statics directory can be accessed by website visitors).",
