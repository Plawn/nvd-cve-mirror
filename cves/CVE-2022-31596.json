  "summary": "Under certain conditions, an attacker authenticated as a CMS administrator and with high privileges access to the Network in SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform (Monitoring DB) - version 430, can access BOE Monitoring database to retrieve and modify (non-personal) system data which would otherwise be restricted. Also, a potential attack could be used to leave the CMS's scope and impact the database. A successful attack could have a low impact on confidentiality, a high impact on integrity, and a low impact on availability.",
