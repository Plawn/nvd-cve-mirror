  "summary": "Zoom Rooms for macOS clients before version 5.11.4 contain an insecure key generation mechanism. The encryption key used for IPC between the Zoom Rooms daemon service and the Zoom Rooms client was generated using parameters that could be obtained by a local low-privileged application. That key can then be used to interact with the daemon service to execute privileged functions and cause a local denial of service.",
