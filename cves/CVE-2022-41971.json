  "summary": "Nextcould Talk android is a video and audio conferencing app for Nextcloud. Prior to versions 12.2.8, 13.0.10, 14.0.6, and 15.0.0, guests can continue to receive video streams from a call after being removed from a conversation. An attacker would be able to see videos on a call in a public conversation after being removed from that conversation, provided that they were removed while being in the call. Versions 12.2.8, 13.0.10, 14.0.6, and 15.0.0 contain patches for the issue. No known workarounds are available.",
