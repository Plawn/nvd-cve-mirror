  "summary": "Campbell Scientific dataloggers CR6, CR300, CR800, CR1000 and CR3000 may allow an attacker to download configuration files, which may contain sensitive information about the internal network. From factory defaults, the mentioned datalogges have HTTP and PakBus enabled. The devices, with the default configuration, allow this situation via the PakBus port. The exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to download, modify, and upload new configuration files.",
